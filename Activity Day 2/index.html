    <h3>Amazing country!</h3>
    <p class="ig"><u>Croatia</u> has been gaining in popularity in recent years. And with good reason! It is where you will find a wonderful climate, with over 2,500 hours of sun per year, beautiful cultural cities, picturesque ports, stunning nature and hundreds of islands. And then we haven’t even mentioned the Croatian coast: the most beautiful in Europe!</p>

    <blockquote>Croatia's extraordinary island-speckled coastline is indisputably its main attraction. The first thing that strikes you is the remarkable clarity of the water. When it's set against a dazzling white pebbly beach, the water sparkles with a jewel-like intensity in shades of emerald and sapphire. There are long sandy and shingly stretches too – perfect for lazy days spent lounging and devouring trashy holiday novels. If that all sounds too relaxing, there are water-based activities at hand to lure you off your sun lounger – snorkelling, diving, kayaking, windsurfing and sailing, just for starters. <cite>Lonely Planet</cite></blockquote>
